# frontend challenge

## Overview
Very basic dropbox clone as described in [frontend challange](https://github.com/gravitational/careers/blob/main/challenges/frontend/challenge.md)

at level 5

### summary requirements

#### Priorities: 
1. Limited Time  
   - functionalities will be kept to minimum 
   - only directly mentioned requirements are going to be implemented
2. Security
   - I will follow [OWASP cheatsheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/)
   - to the extent that time will allow
3. Quality
   - Project will be written test first 
   - though frontend will be written styleguide first 
     - and test will be limited, especially when managing quirks would be to time expensive


#### User interface
##### What is going to be done
 1. List files and directories in a chosen directory 
 2. Navigate directories
 3. Upload files
 4. Search and sort files
 5. User Authentication

##### What is not going to be done
 1. no user authentication related operations (only login)
 2. no file and directory management: no rename, move delete copy (only upload and list)

#### Backend
##### What is going to be done
1. API 
   1. for login 
   2. for directory listing (with authentication verification)
   3. for file upload (with authentication verification)
2. In memory file storage
   1. with some default directory structure 

##### What is not going to be done
 1. no permanent storage 
    1. users and initial directory tree will be hardcoded
    2. new files will be kept in memory 

#### Infrastructure
##### What is going to be done
1. project will be build into single docker image
##### What is not going to be done
1. Deployment
2. Continuous Integration pipeline on github actions to keep project in shape


#### Security
##### 
1. user authentication JWT based
2. minimal package requirements
3. OWASP ZAP tests
4. reduced exposed information by separating frontends for authentication and file management 
##### Bad things - that should be fixed for real world scenario
1. self made ssl certificate 
2. remote loaded fonts and Icons 
3. hardcoded credentials
4. yarn fetches packages every time


## architecture 

### security
 - to expose as little information as possible 
     
   unauthenticated users will receive only login form essential assets.


### 5 components
 app has 5 major components, that could be separated into couple services and authentication proxy
- primary functionality - file management
    1. frontend
    2. backend
- secondary functionality - authentication modules
    3. authentication wrapper (authorize or redirect to login)
    4. login fronted
    5. login backend
    

### keep things simple
- to keep things simple, it's going to be auth wrapper on protected resources handlers
    - 1 backend in GO
        - that hosts login assets on one path
        - files manager assets on the other
        - implements login and file management REST API
    - 1 frontend in TypeScript with 2 builds to 
        - login SPA
        - files manager SPA 

### authentication flow

## Frontend

## Tools
 - prettier
 - TypeScript 
 - React
 - React Router
 - storybook
 - jest
 - dynamically loaded fonts and icons (as font)


### Pages

#### not authenticated = login page


![Login Form](login.png)
![Login Error](login_error.png)


#### File list page - authenticated

#### file details page

## Backend

### tools
- jwt-go
- testify
- golangci-lint

### routes / paths

#### Auth
- POST /API/v1/user/login json {user: string, password: string} 
- ANY  /API/v1/user/logout

#### Files
  all requests here need to be authenticated

  v1 - just a nice touch to make new api versions easily updatable in the future (even though there is no future ;) 
 - GET /API/v1/files/:path? - path should be more of a "slug", generated by the server to deal with wierd cases
   - [{name: "wier$$$ stufff\\", slug: "wierd___stufff", size: 12342, type: "folder|\<file extension\>"}]
 - POST /API/v1/files/:path? - multipart/form-data - standard upload file


#### static resources
 - /login - unprotected, all users only what's needed to render login form
 - /files - protected, authenticated users 
 - / - redirect to /files and from /files to /login if user is not authenticated
